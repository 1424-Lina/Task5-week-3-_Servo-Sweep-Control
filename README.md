# Task5-week-3-_Servo-Sweep-Control
Program three servo motors using an Arduino UNO to perform a sweeping motion (from 0° to 180° and back) for 2 seconds. After the sweep, each servo is set to hold at 90 degrees. The movement is controlled using the Servo library and is intended as a basic motion pattern, suitable for robotic limb or joint simulation.
